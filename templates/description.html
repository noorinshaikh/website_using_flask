  <h1>Content Description</h1>
  <p>This is a website for displaying wildfire data for California and the surrounding areas.<br />
     There is a tabular representation of the fires as well as a map pin pointing the location of fires.<br />
     The map gives extra info such as the population of the area. So fires in more densly populated<br />
     areas may be handled first.</p>
